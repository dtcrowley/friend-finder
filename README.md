# friend-finder

Friend Finder is an app that compares a user's answers to a series of survey questions to those of other users in order to determine potential compatibility. 

The answers are given a value (1-5, from "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly Agree"), and the sum of those answer values for each user are compared against those of others. The closer the sum between users, the higher potential compatibility.

In order to complete the survey questions, simply click on the "Go To Survey" button on the home page. Once you have selected an answer to each question, click the "Submit Survey" button at the bottom of the page. Your results will be tallied and compared against those of other users, and an analysis of your potential compatibility with those users will be displayed. 

Enjoy!
